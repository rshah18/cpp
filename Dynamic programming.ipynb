    "* **What are the subproblems in this case?**\n",
    "* Dynamic programming is a general technique for solving optimization, search and counting problems, that can be decomposed into subproblems \n",
    "* You should consider using DP when ever you have to make choices to arrive at the solution, specifically, when the solution relates to subproblems. \n",
    "* DP solves problem by combining the solutions of multiple smaller problems anc catching the results of intermediate computations\n",
    "* Minimizing cache space is a recurring theme in DP. \n",
    "* Try to compute these problems with 0(n) time and 0(1) space\n",
    "* The **key** to solving a DP problem efficiently is finding a way to break the problem into subproblems such that \n",
    "    * The original problem can be solved relatively easily once solutions to the subproblems are available \n",
    "    * These subproblem solutions are cached\n",
    "* DP is also applicable to counting and decision problems - any problem where you can express a solution recursively in terms of the same computation on smaller instances\n",
    "* Although, DP involves recursion, often for efficiency the cache is build **bottom-up** that is **iteratively**\n",
    "* **When DP is implemented recursively the cache is typically a dynamic data structure such as a hash table or a BST, when its implemented iterarively the cache is usually a one- or multi-dimensional array**\n",
    "* To save space, cache space may be recycled once it is known that a set of entries will not be looked up again\n"
